GitHub is an online platform built on top of Git, a version control system, that allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code projects. It provides a central place where individuals and teams can track changes in their code, work together on the same project from different locations, and maintain a clear history of updates. GitHub also supports open-source development, enabling developers to contribute to projects worldwide and share their own work with the community. Beyond just version control, GitHub offers features like issue tracking, pull requests, project boards, and GitHub Pages for hosting websites, making it a powerful tool for both professional and personal software development.</p>
